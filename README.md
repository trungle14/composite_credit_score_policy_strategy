All the figures and information related to business in presentation are simulated and fictional for the purpose of confidentiality and privacy. 
The purpose of this project is to present logical thinking from my idea of how to optimize credit score cut-off for credit approval with distinct life-time loss rate proven by net profit to the credit policy implementation on production.
