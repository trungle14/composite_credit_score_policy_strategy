In the dynamic landscape of the lending industry, the importance of constructing credit scores based on external credit behavior cannot be overstated. Moving beyond traditional rule-based assessments, such as global maximum debt caps or limiting the number of financial institutions a customer can engage with, offers a more nuanced and accurate reflection of an individual's creditworthiness. By analyzing external credit behaviors, lenders gain insights into the real-world financial habits and reliability of potential borrowers. This approach allows for a more personalized and flexible evaluation process, accommodating the diverse financial situations of applicants. It recognizes that a one-size-fits-all model does not effectively account for the complexities of modern financial life.
